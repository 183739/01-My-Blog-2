#About Page 

I am part of the hog industry. My passion is pigs. Raising hogs is a hobby and a way of life for me, and I am constantly striving to learn all that I can about the hog industry and its ever-changing climate. I first began dealing with pigs through 4-H and since then, I have not been able to get away. I have grown from showing pigs at my county fair, to developing a Supervised Agricultural Experience in FFA, moving to working and becoming a student manager at my collegeâ€™s hog farm, and completing an internship at a commercial hog farm. I have learned so much and have worked to make hog farming my way of life.
