# Farming School 

I am part of the hog industry. My passion is pigs. Raising hogs is a hobby and a way of life for me, I am constantly striving to learn all that I can about the hog industry and its ever-changing climate. I first began dealing with pigs through 4-H and since then, I have not been able to get away. I have grown from showing pigs at my county fair, to developing a Supervised Agricultural Experience in FFA, and moved to working and being a student manager at my collegeâ€™s hog farm and completing an internship at a commercial hog farm. I have learned so much and have worked to make hog farming my way of life. Through my experiences I have developed a unique perspective to raising hogs, this perspective is what I would like to share. My primary focus is going to be my daily activities of working at the hog farm through my college and contributing some of my knowledge that I gained from working at a commercial facility. 

My college operates a small hog farm in southern Missouri. However, we are anything but typical. We have anywhere from 20-30 sows at a given time, but the catch is that our pigs are kept on pasture. A concept that is often considered outdated or simply not practical for the real world. Nevertheless, pasture raised pork is regaining some of its popularity, especially as a specialty product in niche markets. Our operation is focused on learning, as a result we employ various concepts throughout the farm to teach and challenge the students. We do face limitations that prevent experiencing all aspects of the commercial hog industry, but the skills learned can be easily transferred and built upon. 

With this writing experience, I am going to provide you, the reader, with a sense of what I do everyday with my given level of exposure to hogs. I am going to outline daily duties and how we balance being profitable with learning and experimenting. I will describe our selection criteria for pigs, breeding protocols, maintaining animal health and welfare, nutrition and feed, housing and containment in a pasture setting, and our farrowing situation. 

I cannot be fully inclusive or explain every aspect of the concepts of the hog industry. I can only explain what I know and what works for us. However, my hope is that the ideas and practices I discuss will fill you with interest into further research and will provide some new ideas to consider for you own operation. If not these things, then I hope it is at least entertaining and brings awareness to agriculture and the passion of farmers.
