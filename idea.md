# Idea for Blog

## Tentative 

I want to discuss the ideas of sustainable agriculture as they are seen at the hog farm. How to balance conventional practices on a smaller/ low input scale. Being creative with how to operate a profitable enterprise while working with your available resources. There is oportunity to be a  smaller, family focused hog production that can concentrate on niche marketing. 

1. hog selection 
2. feeding strategies
3. housing/ production style 
4. marketing techniques
5. animal health

include day to day activities that refelct these ideas
