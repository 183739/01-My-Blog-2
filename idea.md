# Idea for Blog

## Tentative 

I want to discuss the ideas of sustainable agriculture as they are seen at the hog farm. How to balance conventional practices on a smaller/ low input scale. Being creative with how to operate a profitable enterprise while working with your available resources. There is oportunity to be a  smaller, family focused hog production that can concentrate on niche marketing. I will focus on practices that can be used in the central Missouri region. I will strive to target people who do not already have established hog operations. I will present my ideas as topics to consider when developing a herd. 

blog posts in order:
1. housing/ production style
a. pasture situations
2. hog selection 
3. feeding strategies
4. animal health
5. marketing techniques

Include day to day activities that reflect these ideas.
