# Animal Health & Welfare

Animal health and welfare is the most important concept in the livestock industry. A producer cannot make money on animals that are not cared for properly. Administering to the health of the pigs begins on day one, and even before day one, and continues through the life of the pig. Disease prevention and treatment and administering to physical afflictions are part of the daily routine. 
Vaccinations are a crucial part of animal husbandry. There are several diseases that can be prevented simply by vaccinating. Vaccines are cheap and relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to the price of disease treatment and the losses that occur from ill pigs. Multiple resources are available that outline different vaccination protocols. However, each farm is unique so discuss all vaccines and medicines with your veterinarian and establish a good working relationship. Having a sound vaccination protocol AND following it is extremely important.

Provided was an example of the importance of caring for the animal health and welfare. The gilt was becoming stressed and the health of the piglet was compromised because she was unable to pass the pig. Timely responses in the farrowing process and to accidents help to ensure healthy pigs which leads to better growth and vitality, resulting in more profit at market time.   

## Story

For instance, the other day we had a gilt that finally decided she was going to farrow. We have kept this gilt in our holding pen for a few weeks to monitor her and ensure that she was in good condition to farrow. I was nervous for her because she is a smaller gilt and was unsure of the type of pigs that the boar she was bred to would throw. I was afraid that her pelvis would not be big enough and she would have trouble farrowing. I was right to be concerned. I had just gotten out of class early and was sitting down to work on some unfinished homework when my boss calls me. He asked what I had going on for the rest of the day, and if I had time to come out to the farm and take a look at the gilt since I have the most experience with the farrowing process and the smallest hands. I obliged and drove out to the farm. When I got there, I quickly changed into my work clothes and went to take a look. She had started farrowing early that morning and so far had one live pig and three stillborns. She was still contracting, so I thought the most likely scenario was she had a pig stuck and needed help to get it out. I put on an OB sleeve and lubed up. I cupped my hand and gently reached my hand into the gilt’s vulva and pasted the cervix. Right at her pelvic bone I felt a head. It was going to be a tight fit, so I tried to grab ahold of its head to pull it out. Unfortunately, I could not pull it out, so instead I had to use a special set of forceps. I guided the wire into the birthing canal and worked the wire over the pig’s head and over one leg. If you just get the wire over the head and then try to pull the pig out, it is common for the head to pop off and this leads to more issues. I got the wire situated and working with the gilts contractions was able to successfully pull the pig out. I quickly dried the pig off and set it in the crate next to the sow to nurse. We had to assist the gilt with a few more pigs, but otherwise everything went well and both gilt and piglets are doing fine.
